# Cancer Prediction

### Project Overview
Prediction of cervical cancer based on different attributes by developing and comparing 7 different machine learning classification models and identification of 7 major risk factors of cervical cancer.

### Problem and Motivation
Cervical cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women in developing countries. The regular Pap tests and biopsy, the cancer diagnostic test, have significantly reduced the number of deaths in the developed countries. However, those tests are less accessible in developing countries. While the ability to diagnose the cancer has prevented deaths in the developed world, there is still not a very good understanding of the risk factors. Understanding the likelihood of cervical cancer given different risk factors can motivate women to make better life choices which can help prevent cervical cancer.
Our group aims to explore different risk factors and understand which of the factors strongly affect the likelihood of cervical cancer. This is a classification problem where our model will make a prediction (or classify) whether someone will have a positive or negative biopsy result for cervical cancer based on different risk factors.

### Dataset
The data is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository that has 858 samples, 32 features and 4 possible targets
